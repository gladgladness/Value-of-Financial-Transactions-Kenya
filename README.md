# Value-of-Financial-Transactions-Kenya_Excel_Tableau

<h2>Setup and User Story</h2>
The project contains the analysis of mobile payments, card transactions and the various types of transactions involved in Kenya. Its main purpose is to understand how Kenyans adopt cashless transactions between 2010 and 2022, and the impact that COVID-19 had on cashless transactions.
The project assisted me study and understand more about data analysis using Tableau for the first time. The main challenge that I encountered was adapting to Tableau, considering that I had previously used Power BI severally.

I got my data from Kaggle and enhanced it by adding a primary key.

This project required the use of: 
<ul>
  <li>Tableau Desktop Public Edition</li>
  <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
  <li>Power Query</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
I used two data sets which I cleaned using Excel and Power Query. This was possible through creation of new date fields and changing the data types. I then uploaded them to Tableau and used JOINS to relate the two data sets.

<h2>Creating Report in Tableau</h2>
I put together the sheets and dashboard using:
<ul>
  <li>Table</li>
  <li>Tree maps</li>
  <li>Dual Combo Column Chart</li>
  <li>Scatter Plots</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>
I give credits to Cisco and Curt Frye for the various training materials that I used to understand Tableau and data analytics in a bigger, better way.
